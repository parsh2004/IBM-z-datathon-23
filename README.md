# INTRODUCTION
"Traffic Speed Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks and LSTM" is a smart way to guess how fast cars will be driving on different roads. Instead of just looking at one road at a time, we think about how all the roads are connected, like on a map. This helps us make better predictions about traffic speeds in the future. It's like having a special brain that learns from the past and tells us how fast cars will go on each road."

# Problem
We want to predict future traffic speeds for different road segments, considering not only each segment's history but also how they influence each other.
