# INTRODUCTION
"Traffic Speed Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks and LSTM" is a smart way to guess how fast cars will be driving on different roads. Instead of just looking at one road at a time, we think about how all the roads are connected, like on a map. This helps us make better predictions about traffic speeds in the future. It's like having a special brain that learns from the past and tells us how fast cars will go on each road."

# Problem
We want to predict future traffic speeds for different road segments, considering not only each segment's history but also how they influence each other.

# Approach:
Instead of treating each road segment separately, we create a graph where each road segment is a node, and the traffic speed is a signal on this graph. This way, we consider the relationships between segments.

# Process

## Step 1: Data Preparation
Collect historical data for traffic speeds on different road segments.
## Step 2: Create a Graph
Imagine each road segment as a dot (node) on a map.
Connect the dots (segments) with lines (edges) to represent how they are connected or influence each other.
## Step 3: Model Implementation
Build a neural network model that processes this graph.
Use Graph Convolution Layers to consider segment relationships.
Use LSTM layers to understand how speeds change over time.
## Step 4: Data Input
Prepare your historical traffic speed data for input into the model.
## Step 5: Training
Train the model to learn from the historical data.
## Step 6: Prediction
Use the trained model to predict future traffic speeds based on the graph and historical data.
